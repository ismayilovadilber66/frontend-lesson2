    Hamburger, ground beef. The term is applied variously to  a patty of ground beef, sometimes called hamburg steak, Salisbury steak, or Vienna steak, a sandwich consisting of a patty of ground beef served within a split bread roll, with various garnishes, or the ground beef itself, which is used as a base in many sauces, casseroles, terrines, and the like. Hamburger sandwiches are a staple of fast food and commonly served with french fries.
